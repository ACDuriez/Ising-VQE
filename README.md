# Ising-VQE
Here I show an implementation in qiskit of the VQE algorithm to simulate a particular Ising model that undergoes a phase transition caused by local boundary fields. I also implement the ZNE error mitigation protocol to my algorithm, which improves the performance of the simulation.

Here are some references about the model I analyse: https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03265   https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.024409
