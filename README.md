# Ising-VQE
Here I show an implementation in qiskit of the VQE algorithm to simulate the ground state of a particular spin system that undergoes a phase transition caused by local boundary fields. In the vqe_ising.ipynb notebook I show the main workflow for running both statevector and noisy simulations of the system using qiskit SDK and qiskit-ibm-runtime, however with older version of those packages. For actual scientific purposes the serilialized code in in the script main_quantum.py, which runs the complete workflow, using the solver class in solver.py. These scripts run the simulation already integrated with the latest versions of qiskit SDK and qiskit runtime, and is capable of running on real quantum hardware and with easy error mitigation configurations. 

Here are some references about the model I analyse: https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03265   https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.024409
